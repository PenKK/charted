# Another Full-Stack ToDo List App: [Charted!](https://charted.mooo.com/)

Project was initially created with a friend at [Charter](https://github.com/ryanraen/Charter) where I solely worked on front-end. After leaving the project dormant for a while, I decided to learn back-end development and remake it to support the front-end I had built before. The back-end API, MySQL database, and front-end page files are all self hosted on a secondary computer using Nginx.<br/><br/>

- The website utilizes JsonWebToken through middleware functions to authenticate user logins and actions for an improvement in security. 
- Items support drag and drop.
